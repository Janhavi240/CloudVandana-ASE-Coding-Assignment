# CloudVandana-ASE-Coding-Assignment
In order to fulfill the requirements for the Associate Software Engineer (ASE) position at CloudVandana, I have created a dedicated repository for the coding assignment. This repository is structured to include three separate tasks, each focusing on different aspects of programming. The first task involves Java programming, the second task centers around JavaScript, and the third task delves into HTML and CSS. These tasks collectively showcase my proficiency and versatility in various programming languages and technologies, demonstrating my readiness for the role of ASE at CloudVandana.
